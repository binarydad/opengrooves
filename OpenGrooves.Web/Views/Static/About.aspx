    <h1>About OpenGrooves</h1>

    The OpenGrooves project is a community for connecting local bands and musicians with each other and the fans who support them. It was started by a couple musicians from Baltimore, MD who wanted a way to easily find local bands and events.
    <br /><br />
    The goal of OpenGrooves is to connect the local music scene, and for anyone to quickly be able to find shows in their area. Bands that you would never otherwise hear of would be discovered by hundreds or even thousands of fans. By making this information readily available, local bands, artists, and fans will always be in contact and up-to-date with the local music scene.
